# Travelling salesman problem using some Random Search Algorithms

Travelling salesman problem using some Random Search Algorithms (NN, GA & ACO)

The **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** aims at finding the optimum path so that the salesman visits all the cities once.

**Nearest Neighbour (NN) Algorithm** is a heuristic algorithm that visits the nearby city from its location until it finishes the map.

**Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is a meta-heuristic algorithm that attempts to simulate natural selection to find the best path by crossing-over parents and producing fitter offspring.

**Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm** is a meta-heuristic algorithm where "ants" explore different paths leaving pheromones where they travel further leading the shorter distances to be crossed more and thus have more pheromones for others to follow.

These algorithms do not guarantee optimal solution, but rather reach a sub-optimal or near-optimal solution in a manageable time.
